/**
 * It generates a Semaphore proof, i.e. a zero-knowledge proof that an identity that
 * is part of a group has shared an anonymous message.
 * The message may be any arbitrary user-defined value (e.g. a vote), or the hash of that value.
 * The scope is a value used like a topic on which users can generate a valid proof only once,
 * for example the id of an election in which voters can only vote once.
 * The hash of the identity's scope and secret scalar is called a nullifier and can be
 * used to verify whether that identity has already generated a valid proof in that scope.
 * The depth of the tree determines which zero-knowledge artifacts to use to generate the proof.
 * If it is not defined, it will be inferred from the group or Merkle proof passed as the second parameter.
 * Finally, the artifacts themselves can be passed manually with file paths,
 * or they will be automatically fetched.
 * @param identity The Semaphore identity.
 * @param groupOrMerkleProof The Semaphore group or its Merkle proof.
 * @param message The Semaphore message.
 * @param scope The Semaphore scope.
 * @param merkleTreeDepth The depth of the tree with which the circuit was compiled.
 * @param snarkArtifacts See {@link https://zkkit.pse.dev/interfaces/_zk_kit_utils.SnarkArtifacts.html | SnarkArtifacts}.
 * @returns The Semaphore proof ready to be verified.
